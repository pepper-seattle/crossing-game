===============================

Welcome to the classic arcade game frogger, this time with adorable ladybugs! In this incarnation you will move your adorable hero to a nice dip in the pool for an easy win. Watch out though because any interaction with a pesky bug will put you right back where you started.

Instructions
============
* To move your hero employ the arrow keys on your keyboard.
* If your hero comes in contact with a bug they will be reset to the bottom of the screen and you'll have to try again!
* The border of your game will not allow you to cross, so no trying to cheat your way to victory!
* To win the game you must move your hero from the bottom of the screen into the water area at the top without touching a bug along the way.
